after u start working, it may happen that, ur branch is not merged yet. but you have to start working for the nest branch.
in that case, 
-create a new branch from the old branch that is not yet merged
-then work there and after ur work is done , just rebase (with - i , in case of multiple commits) with the develop branch
-then push the new branch into ur origin (git push origin new_branch)
-then puff a ciger !! :)
